--Where vs Having

=> where clause used to filter individual records, before aggregation (mostly group by)
=> Having does same like where, but can be used with aggregation (mostly group by) => filters out aggregated records

select source_of_joining, count(*) as total from students Group By source_of_joining having total>1;

select source_of_joining, count(*) as total from students Group By source_of_joining 
having source_of_joining=='Linkedin'; => longer time because first groups by everything and then filter out

instead: first filter out linkedin and then group by it  => optimized

select source_of_joining, count(*) as total from students where source_of_joining=='Linkedin' 
Group By source_of_joining; 


--------------------------------------------------

--where and having in same query:

locations from which more than 1 student has joined, but student exp >10

Select location, count(*) as total from students where years_of_exp>10 Group BY location having total>1
