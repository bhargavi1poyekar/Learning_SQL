--Joins

2 tables: 
courses -> parent
students -> child 

=> query : want to know which course enrolled by a particular person

for join, the common column between 2 tables (may not have same name)

select students.student_fname, students.student_lname, courses.course_name from students JOIN courses
ON students.selected_course= courses.course_id ;

=> by default-> join is inner join => only common part 

(left join) in query
=> Left outer join=> matching part+ non matching part of left tables => right table value will be null

(right join) in query
=> Right outer join=> matching part+ non matching part of right tables => left table values will be null

=> full outer join => matching+non matching of right+non matching of left

=> my sql doesn't have full outer join, to simulate, we can take union of left outer join and right outer join
query
union
query

=> union removes duplicated, and gives only distinct values
